Intuitive Git:
Just listing commands now, to not forget myself!

git help
For the built-in help text! With all the essential commands.
git help -g
For the built-in guide!

To get started:
git clone https://github.com/LichenSymbiont/linux-scripts
Or whatever repository you want to clone (copy to your computer, in the folder you are located in).

cd into the directory, like "cd linux-scripts".

So now you can make changes to the repo, and have a terminal open for running Git commands in.

Change your local Git tree:
git add .

Make the files registered in the temporary commit tree to be committed as actual changes to your local repo:
git commit

And if you've just made changes, and not created new folders and files:
git commit -a
This will commit all the changes to files directly (not new files), without having to run "add ." .

Check if there are changes made to the online repo: (and if there are files not committed)
git status

And if there are changes made:
git fetch
Which just gets the Git objects.
git diff [file]

And finally:
git push
To push the committed changes to the online repo.
