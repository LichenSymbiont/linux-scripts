linux-scripts
=============

Mainly small scripts and config files, for my dCore setup.
dCore is a minimalistic live Linux system based on Micro Core (part of the Tiny Core Linux project), which can fetch, manage and install Debian packages.

JWM scripts:

These are just my personal works-good-enough-for-me scripts and config files.
But will get them in shape for being the main WM for dCore (http://wiki.tinycorelinux.net/dcore:welcome?&#dcore).

dCore scripts:

There is just the installation script to start with, for a graphical (X11 and or Vesa, NanoX or the like) install of dCore.

All the scripts for managing a very pure and light dCore system (to replace heavy GUI's with a FLTK program I'm working on), will be placed here.

CSmithy:

This is a simple C/C++ environment for testing simple C/C++ programs.

I'm writing a complete C++ library as a minimal layer to all the basics, and for game engine development (like SDL and SFML, but better). And I don't feel it's ready to share. So I've just started writing a simple C-API for this, and it's not as fun.

I intend to add more simple C++ programs to it, but for now it's just a music generator.
