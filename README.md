linux-scripts
=============

Mainly small scripts and config files, for my dCore setup.

JWM scripts:
These are just my personal works-good-enough-for-me scripts and config files.
But will get them in shape for being the main WM for dCore (http://wiki.tinycorelinux.net/dcore:welcome?&#dcore).

dCore scripts:
There is just the installation script to start with, for a graphical (X11 and or Vesa, NanoX or the like) install of dCore.
