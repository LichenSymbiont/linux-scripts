=== Purpose ===
For testing components of larger programs, and for writing simple C/C++ programs, with the aid of the custom-built CAPI header.
I just wanted to share a simple environment for building simple C/C++ programs by just running make && ./program_name.

=== Programs ===
genmusic:
Just generating a soundwave... will add something more interesting to this soon...

=== Plan ===
I have already made an FLTK-based program for quick prototyping of GUI applications, using DLL's, so the progress for this little testing environment won't be fast.

Feel free to add small example programs and such!

I may add some ncurses examples later.
